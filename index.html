            <h2>What is Air Pollution?</h2>
            <p>Air pollution is the contamination of the atmosphere by harmful substances, including chemicals, particulates, and biological materials. These pollutants can cause adverse effects on human health, wildlife, and the environment. It is one of the most pressing environmental challenges facing the world today, with far-reaching impacts on global ecosystems and the economy.</p>

            <h2>Causes of Air Pollution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vehicle Emissions:</strong> Cars, trucks, and buses release carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial Processes:</strong> Factories emit sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Burning Fossil Fuels:</strong> Coal, oil, and natural gas combustion produce greenhouse gases and particulates.</li>
                <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> The loss of forests reduces the natural filtration of carbon dioxide and pollutants.</li>
                <li><strong>Agricultural Activities:</strong> Methane from livestock and ammonia from fertilizers contribute significantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Causes:</strong> Wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and dust storms also play a role.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="effects">
            <h2>Effects of Air Pollution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Health Problems:</strong> Respiratory diseases, heart conditions, and lung cancer are linked to prolonged exposure.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane contribute to global warming.</li>
                <li><strong>Acid Rain:</strong> Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides react with water to create acidic precipitation.</li>
                <li><strong>Damage to Ecosystems:</strong> Pollutants can harm wildlife and degrade water and soil quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Visibility:</strong> Particulate matter causes smog, affecting transportation and outdoor activities.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="solutions">
            <h2>Solutions to Air Pollution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transition to Renewable Energy:</strong> Use solar, wind, and hydropower to replace fossil fuels.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote Public Transportation:</strong> Reducing vehicle use can cut down emissions significantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Using energy-efficient appliances and buildings lowers pollution.</li>
                <li><strong>Reforestation:</strong> Planting trees improves air quality and sequesters carbon dioxide.</li>
                <li><strong>Legislation:</strong> Governments can enforce stricter emission limits and environmental policies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Global Statistics on Air Pollution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is responsible for an estimated 7 million deaths annually worldwide.</li>
                <li>91% of the worldâ€™s population lives in areas where air quality exceeds WHO guideline limits.</li>
                <li>China and India are among the countries with the highest levels of particulate pollution.</li>
                <li>Indoor air pollution from cooking stoves affects 3 billion people globally, particularly in developing countries.</li>
                <li>The economic cost of air pollution is estimated to be $8.1 trillion annually, approximately 6% of global GDP.</li>
